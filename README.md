## nwHacks 2021 - EatGreen ##

Calling all meat lovers! Our team developed a simple web app that helps individuals to switch their meat-based diet with healthy meat alternatives while maintaining their protein intake. Especially in the midst of COVID-19, we recognize that it has become much harder to keep a healthy lifestyle and wanted to help improve our users' health starting with their diet. For the back end, we used Firebase to store our information in a database, and the front end is developed using React, Material-UI, HTML/CSS.

App Instructions:
1. Click next after navigating to the title page
2. Choose any combination of the meat dishes of your choice
3. Choose any combination of the meat alternative dishes of your choice (check the progress bar for your protein intake)
4. Create a creative and healthy recipe with your given meat alternatives!
